# AWS-HelloWorld-Full-Stack-Project

This is a full stack application done with AWS. AWS Amplify is the frontend console where the user connects to the backend. AWS Lambda and AWS API Gateway allow for the translation of information between the frontend and backend. Finally, there is AWS Dynamo Database which serves as the backend where the user performs queries on the database's contents through the console.

There is currently a bug where the console is not displaying the correct message to the user when a query doesn't exist in the database.
